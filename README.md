# Time-Management-Web-App

This application was designed to work as an event scheduling calendar, much like Google Calendar. It was largely developed in React & Eclipse IDE. 

- I utilized several Javascript libraries, including ‘React,’ App,’ ReactDOM,’ reportWebVitals,’ userEvent,’ useRef,’ useState,’ TLDs’ from TLDs file, and more.
- All pages are connected through the React router.
- All pages are designed using CSS.
- Implemented using MySQL database (still in the works).
- App functionalities (Fully developed using Javascript in React) -
  - Sign-up/Log-in page
    - Contains all password/username/birthday/etc. requirements.
  - Working calendar (all years, even leap years)
    - Each day contains scheduling capabilities for different events.
- Has Java methods to create user sign-up, user log-in, event, etc. objects to save it in the database.
